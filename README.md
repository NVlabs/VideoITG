VideoITG is an innovative approach to video understanding, designed to enhance the performance of Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) through informed frame selection. It tackles the complexities of real-world video scenarios by aligning frame sampling with user instructions. VideoITG employs a comprehensive pipeline that includes detailed clip-level description generation, question-guided clip retrieval, and task-specific frame selection. This results in a robust dataset of 40K videos and 480K annotations. The plug-and-play model leverages visual language alignment and reasoning, achieving superior results across multimodal benchmarks, particularly in tasks requiring precise temporal grounding.

## Install
Please following the guide here to prepare the environment on **Linux OS**.
<!-- currently does not support windows and MacOS -->

1. Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NVlabs/VideoITG.git
cd VideoITG
```

2. Create environment and install package
```Shell
conda create -n videoitg python=3.12 -y
conda activate videoitg
pip install --upgrade pip  # enable PEP 660 support
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Install additional packages for training cases
```bash
pip install flash-attn==2.4.2 --no-build-isolation
```

## Training Data

### VideoLLM Data
For VideoLLM training, wew use the same data and stragety as LLaVA-Video, including the [Pretraining Data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/liuhaotian/LLaVA-CC3M-Pretrain-595K), [OV SFT Data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lmms-lab/LLaVA-OneVision-Data) and [LLaVA-Video Data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lmms-lab/LLaVA-Video-178K).


### VideoITG Data


## Checkpoint Preparation
We recommend using the VideoLLM checkpoints we provided [here](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/VideoITG-8B) to reproduce our results.

## Training
You can train the model following:

```bash
bash scripts/videoitg/finetune-uni-64frame-qwen2-7b-grounding.sh finetune 16
```

In default we use 128 NVIDIA A100 80G GPU to conduct the training. Please modify the `per_device_train_batch_size` and `gradient_accumulation_steps` if you are using different amount of GPUs. The training for VideoITG requires 4 hours.

### Notes
If you have limited GPU resources or memory, please considering the following:

- use gradient accumulation and reduce the per-device batch size

## Evaluation

### Evaluation with LMMs-Eval
For evaluation, we use Videomme as an example.
First, using this command to run our VideoITG model and get the instructed grounding results.

```bash
bash scripts/eval_lmms_eval/videomme_grounding.sh $REPO_ID_OR_LOCAL_PATH $MODEL_NAME $CONV_MODE
```
### Notes
In our paper, we report the results of CG-Bench mini, which includes 3,000 QA pairs.
